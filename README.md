# Dog-Breed-classifier
In this project, I learnt how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
